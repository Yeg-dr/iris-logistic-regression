# Iris Logistic Regression  

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates **Logistic Regression** on the well-known **Iris dataset**. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, performance evaluation, and visualization of classification results.  

## Features  

âœ… Uses **Scikit-Learn** for model training  
âœ… Evaluates model performance using **accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports**  
âœ… **Visualizes decision boundaries** for better interpretability  
âœ… Includes **example outputs** and **model insights**  

## Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/iris-logistic-regression.git
   cd iris-logistic-regression

## Usage

1. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Iris_LogisticRegression.ipynb



## Dependencies

âœ… Python 3.x /n
âœ… Jupyter Notebook
âœ… Scikit-Learn
âœ… Pandas
âœ… Matplotlib
âœ… NumPy

## Dataset

The Iris dataset is included in Scikit-Learn and consists of 150 samples from three species of iris flowers:
ðŸŒ¿ Setosa
ðŸŒ¿ Versicolor
ðŸŒ¿ Virginica

Each sample has four features:

Sepal length
Sepal width
Petal length
Petal width

## Model Insights

The Logistic Regression model was trained to classify iris species based on these four features. Below are some performance results:

## ðŸŽ¯ Accuracy

Achieved high accuracy (~95-97%) on test data.

## ðŸ“Š Decision Boundary Visualization

A plot showing how the logistic regression model separates the three classes:

## ðŸ”¢ Confusion Matrix

An example confusion matrix for model predictions:
   ```bash
   [[18  0  0]
    [ 0 15  2]
    [ 0  1 14]]
This shows that the model correctly classified most of the samples with only a few misclassifications.
